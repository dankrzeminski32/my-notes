#### Databases Overview

From Spreadsheets to Databases

**Spreadsheets**

- One time analysis
- quick charts
- small datasets
- untrained individuals

**Databases**

- Data Integrity (cant just click a cell and change it)
- massive data amounts
- quick combine different datasets
- automation
- backend for web apps and apps

**Comparison** 

- Tabs in excel are like tables in a database
- rows and columns are the same

**Database Platforms**

- PostgreSQL =  free & Open Source
- MySQL & MariaSQL = Free & Open Source, widely used on internet
- MS SQL Server Express = Free but has limitations, compatible with SQL Server (windows) only
- Microsoft access = Cost is bad -, not easy to use just SQL
- SQlite = Free (open source), mostly command line.

PostgreSQL is great for learning SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the programming langauge used to communicate with databases

SQL is used in so much! 

- MySQL
- PostGreSQL
- Oracle Databases
- MS Access
- Amazon Redshift
- Looker 
- MemSQL
- Periscope Data
- Hive (runs on top of hadoop)
- BigQuery
- Facebook's Presto


All of these applications use SQL in the background

Most of the commands we learn are **not** specific to PostGreSQL
